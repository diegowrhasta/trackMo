# trackMo

Tracking application built in Blazor (not as fancy as you think)

## How to run

This uses `docker compose`. So that you can get everything up and running with one command. So just stand at the 
directory in which `compose.yml` is, and run `docker compose up`. That shoud be more than enough.
